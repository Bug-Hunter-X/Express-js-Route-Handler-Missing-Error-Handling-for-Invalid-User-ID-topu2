This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input. The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, which doesn't handle cases where the user ID is not a valid integer.  `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling, preventing unexpected crashes and improving the application's robustness.
